KISS-surveillance -- A dead-simple video surveillance tool. 

Dependencies:
* Supervisor (http://supervisord.org/)
* wget (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)

Installation:
0) Install the dependencies.
1) Copy 'kiss-serve.sh' to the desired path.
2) Edit add the content of 'supervisor/kiss-serve.conf' to your Supervisor config-file 
   (or add it as an include). Make sure to update the 'command' line to match the path in 1). 
3) Edit 'kiss-serve.sh'. If you are only monitoring one camera, update the following:
	* Set 'BASE' to where you want to store the images. Make sure 'user' from the
	  Supervisor-config can write to this path.
	* Make sure set 'CAM1' to match the path to where wget can fetch an image from the camera.
		* If you have multiple cameras, configure 'CAM2' and uncomment the second wget-string.
		* You may also want to modify 'DAYSTOKEEP'. This is the value the cleanup-process
		  uses when determining what to keep and delete.
4) Add a cronjob for the cleanup. The following entry should be sufficient:
00 1	* * *	www-data	/path/to/kiss-serve.sh cleanup

That should be it to get you started.
