KISS-surveillance -- A dead-simple video surveillance tool. 

Dependencies
=============

* Supervisor (http://supervisord.org/)
* wget (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)

Compatibility  
=============

Cameras: 
Any IP-based video camera that can output static images over HTTP or HTTPS.

Operating System:
Any recent UNIX/Linux distribution should work (but only tested on Ubuntu).

Installation
=============

0) Install the dependencies.

1) Copy 'kiss-serve.sh' to the desired path.

2) Edit add the content of 'supervisor/kiss-serve.conf' to your Supervisor
   config-file (or add it as an include). Make sure to update the 'command'
   line to match the path in 1). 

3) Edit 'kiss-serve.sh'. If you are only monitoring one camera, update the
   following:
	* Set 'BASE' to where you want to store the images. Make sure 'user' from
	  the Supervisor-config can write to this path. Also, make sure sure you
	  enough disk space. Recording images from one camera in 640x480 every 
	  second (DELAY=1) consumes about ~80GB for each 30 days (DAYSTOKEEP=30).
	* Make sure set 'CAM1' to match the path to where wget can fetch an image
	  from the camera.
		* If you have multiple cameras, configure 'CAM2' and uncomment the
		  second wget-string.
	* Configure the 'DELAY'-variable to configure the delay between
	  recordings. By default, it is one second.
	* You may also want to modify 'DAYSTOKEEP'. This is the value the
	  cleanup-process uses when determining what to keep and delete.

4) Add a cronjob for the cleanup. The following entry should be sufficient:
00 1	* * *	www-data	/path/to/kiss-serve.sh cleanup

5) If you want to view the recorded images from a web-server, simply install
   and configure a web-server to do an index the folders. I prefer Nginx
   for this. 

That should be it to get you started.
